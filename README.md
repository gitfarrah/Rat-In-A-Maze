# Rat-In-A-Maze üêÄ

The Rat in a Maze project is a C++ program designed to find the shortest path for a rat to reach its destination in a maze using backtracking and state space tree approach. The program utilizes data structures such as arrays, stacks, and queues to represent the maze and keep track of the rat's movements. The algorithm used in the program is based on the backtracking technique, which involves exploring all possible paths from the starting point to the destination and choosing the shortest path. The state space tree approach is used to generate all possible paths and determine the shortest one. The program also includes error handling to prevent infinite loops and ensure that the rat can reach its destination in a finite amount of time. Overall, the Rat in a Maze project demonstrates a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms, and their practical application in solving real-world problems.
